    <h2>Types of Coffee Beans</h2>

      <p>All commercial coffee comes from two main types of coffee beans: arabica and robusta. Each type has its own unique qualities, though the exact flavor depends on how it is roasted.</p>

      <h3>Arabica</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Fine, mild, aromatic</li>
          <li>50% to 60% less caffeine</li>
          <li>Expensive to cultivate</li>
          <li>Approximately 70% of world’s coffee production</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Robusta</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Used in blends, instant coffee</li>
            <li>50% to 60% less caffeine</li>
            <li>Easier, cheaper to cultivate</li>
            <li>Approximately 30% of world’s coffee production</li>
          </ul>


    <h2>Origins of Coffee Beans</h2>

      <p>Ethiopia is the origin of both arabica and robusta beans, but they each now grow in a variety of different countries across the world map, especially in Latin America, Central America, Africa and parts of Asia. Arabica beans are primarily grown in Brazil but can also be found in countries like Colombia, Honduras and Mexico. Robusta also grows in Brazil but is even more common in Vietnam; other robusta coffee growing regions include Indonesia, India, and Uganda.</p>

      <p>The following is based on the number of 132 pound (60 Kilogram) bags produced during the 1997-98 crop year, according to the U.S. National Coffee Association.</p>

    <h2>Coffee Brewing Methods</h2>

      <dl>
        <dt>Drip Filtration</dt>

          <dd>The drip method is by far the most widely used coffee brewing method. The concept is simple. With hot water (almost boiling) is poured or sprayed over the ground coffee, contained in a filter, and allowed to drip into a container of some sort.</dd>

        <dt>Vacuum Filtration</dt>

            <dd>The vacuum brewer has three parts: a lower chamber for serving, an upper chamber for extraction, and a filter. The apparatus is assembled with a steam-tight seal between the upper and lower chambers, with a filter right in the middle. The filter allows hot water to pass through, but the mesh size prevents coffee grounds from penetrating.</dd>

        <dt>Steeping (French Press, Unpressurized Infusion)</dt>

            <dd>Conceptually, steeping is the simplest way to make coffee. Just mix hot water (almost boiling) with ground coffee, allow the two to blend together, and separate the brew from the spent coffee grounds. The french press (press pot or plunge pot) works exclusively on the steeping method.</dd>

        <dt>Pressurized Infusion (Espresso)</dt>

            <dd>Espresso is usually brewed using extra fine ground coffee and either a pump or steam espresso machine. To make espresso, super-hot water or steam is infused into packed espresso grounds under pressure to maximize extraction. The hot water is allowed to remain in contact with the espresso grounds for a little bit, until the shot is "pulled" all at once into a demitasse cup.</dd>
